    <p class="text">Being a product manager is my true role. I love driving products from concept to reality by connecting business, development, and design.</p>
    <p class="text">But defining my role as a product manager can be difficult at times because every circumstance need something different. I am constantly having to adapt to the needs of the product, market, and teammates while balancing both budget and time.</p>
    <p class="text">So I spent some time today researching more about how other people define the role of a product manager and the techniques they use to optimize their effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="text">I found a lot of stuff, but one that I really like is this diagram.</p>

    <p class="text">When thinking about building products, all aspects need to be considered and if one of the circles is unmet, the product is bound to fail.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm excited to learn more and to start applying for roles as a PM.</p>
