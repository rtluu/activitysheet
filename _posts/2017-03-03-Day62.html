  <p class="text">We added an ssl certificate to Stash today to secure the site, especially now that we have users logging in to use the service.</p>

  <p class="text">However, the new https security created a pretty significant issue for embedding webpages. Any webpage that is not secure (http) will not embed inside of a https site because it poses a sercurity risk.</p>
  <p class="text">That's extremely unfortunate and we're looking into solutions such as setting up proxy calls for http sites through https connections as well as doubling down on screenshotting webpages for sites that don't embed.</p>
