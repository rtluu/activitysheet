<div class="post-container">
  <p class="text">I had a great conversation today with an old friend about her problems collecting content at work. She's works in government and spends a lot of time researching politicians collecting articles, videos and more.</p>
  <p class="text">She said that she's been using sticky notes to collect links and write notes, but that is has gotten extremely unorganized and overwhelming.</p>
  <p class="text">The conclusion of the conversation was that she needed a solution that she equated to "Pinterest for the workplace." Once she said it, it was immeadiately evident that that was the niche we need to pursue.</p>
  <p class="text">I suggested for her to try the beta and will be following up with her and her team to learn more about how we can improve their collection and collaboration.</p>
