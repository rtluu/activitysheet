<div class="post-container">
  <p class="text">I applied to two PM jobs in San Jose that look promising. I've always loved the valley and if I do land a job out there, it would be almost impossible to decline.</p>
  <p class="text">After work hours, I attended a hacker meetup with Diego.</p>

  <p class="text">We spent time working on the error messages for user registration.</p>

  <p class="text">Osebo also wanted to see what it would look like if we used a museum style view for Stash's cards, so I built a quick prototype.</p>

  <p class="text">The design is nice, but items that only have a favicon or no image at all create gaps in the layout. Another concern is that it only adds content to the left column rather than adding items across horizontally in rows. That may cause confusion for the user in regards to which items were most recently saved.</p>
  <p class="text">I don't think we're quite ready to implement something like the museum view until we can grab screenshots of webpages that don't have meta images. More on this in the future.</p>
