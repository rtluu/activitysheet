<div class="post-container">
    <p class="text">I want to make it easier for people to view my activity sheet without having to click through each title to view a post.</p>
    <p class="text">So I'm using Jekyll's excerpt mechanism to show each post on the home page. I'm also going to need to restyle the posts a little bit to make a clear visual transition between posts.</p>
    <p class="text">I only got a few hours of sleep last night so I'll tackle that tomorrow.</p>
