    <p class="text">I want to make it easier for people to view my activity sheet without having to click through titles to see each post.</p>
    <p class="text">So I'm using Jekyll's excerpt mechanism to show each post on the home page. I also restyled the way the posts are presented on the homepage to provide clear separation between each entry.</p>
