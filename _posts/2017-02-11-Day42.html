  <p class="text">I really enjoy sharing updates on the things I'm building, but somedays it isn't so glamorous.</p>
  <p class="text">Today, I worked a double for my photography job and was out of the house from 9am to 1am. It was long, and tiring.</p>
  <p class="text">BUT, I can't complain because this job gives me the flexibility to focus my energy on creating during the work week.</p>
