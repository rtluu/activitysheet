  <p class="text">On Tuesday, I have a interview with Vimeo for a Creative Technologist position with a focus on their video player. I'm excited!</p>
  <p class="text">I have a lot of experience working with YouTube's player, but I haven't spent much time working with Vimeo's player yet. I thought it would be a cool challenge to see if I could recreate hover to play viewing with Vimeo's player.</p>

  <p class="text">I'm not quite sure how difficult it's going to be, but it should be fairly straightforward.</p>
