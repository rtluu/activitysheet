  <p class="text">The truth is out there, but recently people with power have been using their influence to publicly dispute facts and create obstacles to make it difficult for citizens to access important information.</p>
  <p class="text">Osebo and I decided that we needed to do our part in helping people access fact based information on environmental, social, economic, and educational issues.</p>
  <p class="text">We chose the name "Hidden Info" because we're committed to uncovering the truth. We'll strive to be unbiased and our writing will require a great deal of research and fact checking to ensure we put out is 100% truthful. We will be providing sources for our findings.</p>
  <p class="text">Today we whipped up a basic prototype just to get a sense for what we need to include in the experience.</p>
