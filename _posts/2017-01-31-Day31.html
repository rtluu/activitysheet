  <p class="text">I took a trip downtown to tour two different WeWork offices today. The first one was near the White House and the other was in Dupont Circle.</p>

  <p class="text">It was nice to work in a new environment and I was able to check off all but one of my tickets on the sprint board. Another plus was being able to get feedback from random people in the coworking space.</p>
  <p class="text">I'm not sure if it makes sense for me to commit to the coworking space at this point, but I'm going to sleep on it.</p>
