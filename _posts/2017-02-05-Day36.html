  <p class="text">Superbowl Sunday is basically a holiday in the US, but I did have a photography gig this morning in Baltimore. Luckily it ended at 4pm, so I was still able to participate in the Superbowl festivities.</p>
  <p class="text">The game was between the Atlanta Falcons & the New England Patriots. The first three quarters of the game were all Atlanta with the Falcons holding a 28 to 3 lead at one point.</p>
  <p class="text">But some how, Tom Brady led his team back in the 4th quarter to tie the game at 28, force overtime, and drive down the field in overtime to score a game winning touchdown to win his 5th Superbowl. Epic.</p>

  <p class="text">It goes to show that the greatest winners in life, never give up no matter how grim the situation looks.</p>
