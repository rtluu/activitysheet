  <p class="text">Sid, Osebo and I were able to get a MVP version of Rainbow working!</p>

  <p class="text">It's been quite a challenge due to a couple unforseen constraints. The primary one is the inability to build and make changes locally. In order for the experience to work, the user must authenticate with soundcloud's api.</p>
  <p class="text">Despite the roadblocks, we've been able to get a list of people you follow and when you select someone, it shows their soundcloud likes via embeds. Soundcloud's embeds are pretty load heavy so we've implemented lazy loading to reduce load times.</p>
  <p class="text">Next we're looking at creating our own soundcloud player so we don't need to rely on the embeds and can create a more fluid experience where songs play in successsion.
