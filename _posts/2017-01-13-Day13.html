    <p class="text">I've been making a lot of progress with my personal site and it is almost complete.</p>
    <p class="text">But I hit a road block trying to deploy via gulp to gh-pages. Only the index.html file is getting deployed and I'm trying to figure out why the other files aren't compiling.</p>
    <p class="text">It's frustrating when you do all the research, but the answer is still unclear.</p>
    <p class="text">I'll tackle the problem tomorrow before going to Kristina's company party.</p>
    <p class="text">p.s. I got through a few chapters of the PM Interview book and it is very insightful!</p>
