    <p class="text">To start 2017, my <a href="http://brendanluu.github.io">brother</a>, <a href="http://osebo.github.io/activitysheet">Osebo</a> and I decided to make activity sheets to push ourselves to create new stuff everyday.</p>
    <p class="text">I'll use this space to document the things I'm working on, share my ideas and record my journey.</p>
    <p class="text">Today I upgraded to a new '15 macbook 🙌🏼 . It's nice to start a new year with fresh hardware that will allow me to continue to improve my programming and design.</p>
    <p class="text">One of the things I'm looking forward to most in 2017 is building <a href="http://stash.ag">Stash</a>. Osebo, Diego and I have been working hard and will be relasing an MVP soon. Off to the races.</p>
