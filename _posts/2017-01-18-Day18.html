    <p class="text">My job hunt is underway. I applied to 7 Prodcut Manager jobs today. 5 in DC and 2 in NYC.</p>
    <p class="text">The one that's currently top of my list is a PM role 1776 (startup space on 15th st.). I'd love to stay engaged with entrepreneurs and I'm already well connected with the DC tech community.</p>
    <p class="text">I've also compiled an ongoing list of positions that I'll continue to apply for daily.</p>
