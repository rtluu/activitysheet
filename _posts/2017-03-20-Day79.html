<div class="post-container">
  <p class="text">I've been rejected many times in my life and I faced another one today from the company I interviewed with on Friday.</p>
  <p class="text">It's never easy. It always sucks. But I've learned a lot from those rejections.</p>

  <p class="text">I'm not afraid of failure. I'm going to keep shooting until I make that game winning shot. I'm going to continue to put out applications until I find the right job.</p>
  <p class="text">Everything happens for a reason and it's almost fated that I got a response today for another video interview next week.</p>
