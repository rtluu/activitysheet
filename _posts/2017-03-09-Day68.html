  <p class="text">We're changing the brand from Stash to eego. This transition is about a month in the making, but we're finally ready to begin the rebranding.</p>
  <p class="text">While Stash is a fairly good name, it is highly overused and terrible for brand recognition in SEO, especially with a .ag domain name.</p>
  <p class="text">Osebo came up with eego because collections serve as a symbol of an individual's identity. With that in mind, our goal is to help people create collections they're proud of.</p>
