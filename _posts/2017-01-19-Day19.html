    <p class="text">Today Diego and I spent some quality time together working on Stash. We're working on creating left and right arrows for moving between items within the overlay.</p>
    <p class="text">It required quite of bit of refactoring and requires manipulating the global state with Redux.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm happy that Diego has been taking the time to walk me through the relationships between the actions, dispatches, reducers and states.</p>
    <p class="text">Learning this component based framework is hard work, but I know it will pay off. Excited to share the experience with you soon.</p>
