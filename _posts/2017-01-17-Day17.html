    <p class="text">I've been reading that book on nailing the PM interview and have been picking up ways to improve my resume. I decided to completely redesign the layout, rewrite the copy and I added a references section.</p>
    <p class="text">I also met with my mentor, Seda, today at BunkerLabs and told her about my ambition to land a job as a Product Manager. She gave me a lot of great advice and told me that in addition to redoing my resume that I needed to update my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ryanluu">LinkedIn</a>. So I did.</p>
