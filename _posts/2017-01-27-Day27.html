  <p class="text">My web work day got shortened because I went to work as a photographer tonight in DC.</p>
  <p class="text">One of the things I was learning about before I left was how to create a museum view for Stash's cards. The main problem with the current version is that items are added in columns instead of in rows. The only way to get the items to position themselves in rows is to use a technique called Masonry.</p>

  <p class="text">There are plugins that enable this dynamic positioning in React that I will need to use to create this effect. That'll have to wait a couple days though because I'm headed to NYC with Kristina tomorrow morning ðŸ—½!</p>
