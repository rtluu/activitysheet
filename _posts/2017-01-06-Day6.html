    <p class="text">I realized that I got ahead of myself with my first crack at my personal site.</p>
    <p class="text">Osebo suggested that I take more time to think through the purpose of my personal site and to sketch multiple iterations before touching the computer.</p>
    <p class="text">My goals with my personal site are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Showcase my web work through individual case studies.</li>
      <li>Convey my multi-disciplinary background and experience.</li>
      <li>Capture viewers attention and entice them to contact me.</li>
      <li>Keep things minimal while adding my own personal flare.</li>
      <li>Use a new Javascript library to create a unique interactive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">I also think I'm going to build my personal site in gulp.js. I've never used it before, but I know it's fast and I've heard good things.</p>
