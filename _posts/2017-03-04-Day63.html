  <p class="text">Stash's mobile experience is getting some updates and one thing that we noticed was that the having the login/signup switch at the bottom of the form for mobile is hidden and inconvenient. I refactored the trigger for mobile to allow users to switch between login/signup at the top of the registraion block.</p>
