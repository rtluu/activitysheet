  <p class="text">The needs of each team change over time and as a product manager it's my job to make decisions to improve the effectiveness of the team's workflow.</p>
  <p class="text">With all of our team members having full time commitments (jobs, school, clients), our building process with Stash has been divided and inconsistent. This has led to a gap between design and development where neither side is aware of what the other is working on. We have a sprint board for development, but the design work hasn't been tracked.</p>
  <p class="text">Our team needs a better way to keep track of all of our work in one place so we can set goals together, log our work, and hold each other accountable. The solution is to include design objectives to our sprint board and shorten the sprints to one week.</p>

  <p class="text">I'm excited to see how this improves our workflow. Grind time.</p>
