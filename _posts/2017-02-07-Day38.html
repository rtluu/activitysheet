<div class="post-container">
  <p class="text">I started working on a lazy loading feature for Stash that would optimize loading efficiency for the experience and more importantly reduce the amount of calls we make to iframely. The more calls we make the more money we pay, so this is an important improvement.</p>
  <p class="text">Osebo and I have also been trying to figure out a new brand identify for Stash because of the confusion that's created by other companies that have the same name.</p>
  <p class="text">Today we came up with forshow.co. I actually really like it. Creating collections for showing other people is the goal, so the name makes a lot of sense.</p>
