    <p class="text">I got a new client today; a company called 4DWW. They do live web broadcasts and web meetings.</p>
    <p class="text">My job is to build them a webpage that has a live streaming video player embedded inside of it via JW player.
    <p class="text">In order to do so I need to link up an Amazon EC2 server with a software called Wowza that will stream the video to a JW embed.</p>
    <p class="text">It's an interesting challenge and I need to do some more due diligence to figure out the best approach.</p>
