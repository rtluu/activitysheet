  <p class="text">Deploying tech products is simultaneously exciting and strenuous.</p>
  <p class="text">We've merged our changes together and when we deployed them to staging there were multiple unforeseen errors. It's easy to forget how much testing is involved before launching a good product and I need to spend some more time working with the guys to iron out the bugs.</p>
  <p class="text">We also closed a sprint today and outlined what we're working on next. Good things are coming!</p>
