    <p class="text">Part of the reason I love having an activity sheet is that it holds me accountable to the goals I set.</p>
    <p class="text">One of my goals is to read more and when my friend Andrew recommended these two books to me today, it seemed like a great opportunity to commit.</p>
    <p class="text">I've purchased the first one 'Cracking the PM Interview' as an amazon kindle e-read and I'm going to try and read it on my phone while I'm at the gym.</p>
    <p class="text">I read the first few pages and I can tell that it going to be a good read.</p>
