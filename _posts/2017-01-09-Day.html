    <p class="text">I spent time today refining the purpose, vision, and design for my personal site.</p>
    <p class="text">Highlighting my frontend work is a priority, so I've made it easy to access my work from a fixed sidebar on the right.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm also going to make the images interactive. When a visitor hovers over one of the designs, it will trigger an accompanying video that will show engagements like hover to play or chopping a video.</p>
    <p class="text">It is definitely a thought provoking process breaking down what's important and I'm excited to see it take shape.</p>
