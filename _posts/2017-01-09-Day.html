<div class="post-container">
    <p class="text">I spent time today continuing to refine the purpose and vision for my personal site.</p>
    <img src="/post-images/site_mockup_v2.png"/>
    <p class="text">Highlighting my frontend work is a priority, so I've made it easy to access my work from a fixed sidebar on the right.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm also going to make the images interactive. When a visitor hovers over one of the design it will showcase a unique engagement like hover to play or chopping a video.</p>
    <p class="text">It is definitely a thought provoking process breaking down what's important and I'm excited to see it take shape.</p>
