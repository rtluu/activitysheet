  <p class="text">Rainbow is a side project to help people discover music their friends are listening to. Osebo, Sid and I worked to put together the first working UX.</p>

  <p class="text">Users sign in with their SoundCloud account and Rainbow shows a list of the people they are following. When a user clicks on one of their friends, their friend's liked songs from SoundCloud will display in the feed.</p>
  <p class="text">A working demo will be ready by this weekend.</p>
