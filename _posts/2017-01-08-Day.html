    <p class="text">Products need to solve problems. Whether it's telling you the time or autonomously driving you to work, products are created to solve a human problem.</p>
    <p class="text">Today, Osebo and I interviewed a bio-med engineering masters student named Mishi.</p>

    <p class="text">She was super nice and gave us a lot of great insight into her daily experience of discovering and saving online. Her go-to service is/was Tumblr, but it's gotten really cluttered and difficult for her to easily revisit her favorite content.</p>
    <p class="text">The conversation was extremely helpful in identifying where her painpoints lie and how we can shape Stash's experience to solve her problems.</p>
    <p class="text">Talking with Mishi also gave us a better understanding of who our target audience is. I'm not going to draw any conclusions yet, but we're excited to conduct more interviews to see if there are any consistent patterns.</p>
