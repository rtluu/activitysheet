  <p class="text">Getting both design and development back together on the sprint board was very effective in helping the team stay on track and we were able to set clear objectives for the next week.</p>
  <p class="text">We have a collage view in the pipeline that will replace the grid view and we're finishing up profiles so users can truly create their own stashes. In the meantime, checkout the latest version <a href="http://staging.stash.ag">here</a>.</p>
