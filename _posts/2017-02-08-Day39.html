<div class="post-container">
  <p class="text">Today I spent time rebuilding the navigation for Forshow; including a new design of the add item form.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/k5rlSUQ.gif?1"/>
  <p class="text">Below the nav bar, we have added a user profile block. For an anonymous user it will have a smiley face and once they log in it will show their username and have the ability to add a photo (which we still need to build).</p>
  <p class="text">It's coming together, but there are still a lot of things to get done in this sprint.</p>
