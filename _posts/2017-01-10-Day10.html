    <p class="text">Gulp is a javascript task runner that helps automate tasks like bundling code and minifying images/gifs etc.</p>
    <p class="text">Because my personal site will have a lot of heavy imagery, I decided to use gulp to build my personal site so that it's fast and snappy.</p>
    <p class="text">I like it's plugin/modular infrastructure and the fact that it uses sass by default.</p>
    <p class="text">On another note, the site design continues to change as I show people and get feedback. I'm think I'm goint to adjust my user flow so that there are individual pages for each project.</p>
    <p class="text">It's cool to see how it changes day over day.</p>
