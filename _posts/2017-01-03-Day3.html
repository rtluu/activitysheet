    <p class="text">I didn't get any sleep last night. I was with my gf in the hospital overnight and it was pretty brutal.</p>
    <p class="text">Luckily, I brought my hotspot/laptop and while we were waiting I decided to rebuild my activity sheet in Jekyll per suggestion of Osebo.</p>
    <p class="text">Creating posts are sooo much easier and it improves the load efficiency significantly.</p>
    <p class="text">We were having trouble getting the images in the yaml frontmatter to render on the homepage, but I was able to figure it out. It makes the homepage way more appealing.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm going to continue to push myself to experiment with new programming languages this year. Some of the ones I'm currently interested in are Angular, Gulp and React. I'll keep buildings new things and will post them here.</p>
