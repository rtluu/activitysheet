  <p class="text">My web work day got shortened because I went to work as a photographer tonight in DC.</p>
  <p class="text">One of the things I was learning about before I left was how to create a museum view for Stash's cards. The main problem with the current version is that items are added in columns instead of in rows. The only way to get the items to position themselves in rows is to use a technique called Masonry.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/LUewtho.gif"/>
  <p class="text">There are plugins that enable this dynamic positioning in React that I will need to use to create this effect. That'll have to wait a couple days though because I'm headed to NYC with Kristina tomorrow morning 🗽!</p>

  <p class="text">The truth is out there, but recently people with power have been using their influence to publicly dispute facts and create obstacles to make it difficult for citizens to access important information.</p>
  <p class="text">Osebo and I decided that we needed to do our part in helping people access fact based information on environmental, social, economic, and educational issues.</p>
  <p class="text">We chose the name "Hidden Info" because we're committed to uncovering the truth. We'll strive to be unbiased and our writing will require a great deal of research and fact checking to ensure we put out is 100% truthful. We will be providing sources for our findings.</p>
  <p class="text">Today we whipped up a basic prototype just to get a sense for what we need to include in the experience.</p>

  <p class="text">We spent time working on the error messages for user registration.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/iU9ZWCM.gif?1"/>
  <p class="text">Osebo also wanted to see what it would look like if we used a museum style view for Stash's cards, so I built a quick prototype.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1f1135p.gif"/>
  <p class="text">The design is nice, but items that only have a favicon or no image at all create gaps in the layout. Another concern is that it only adds content to the left column rather than adding items across horizontally in rows. That may cause confusion for the user in regards to which items were most recently saved.</p>
  <p class="text">I don't think we're quite ready to implement something like the museum view until we can grab screenshots of webpages that don't have meta images. More on this in the future.</p>
