  <p class="text">This past month I mentioned that I had acquired a new client that is looking to build a livestreaming video platform for webroadcasts and webinars.</p>
  <p class="text">We've spent the past few weeks outlining a scope of work and digging into the details to develop a full understanding of the company vision as well as what's required to get to an MVP.</p>
  <p class="text">After multiple sessions of ironing out the specifics, it became apparent that the best path to success wasn't to just start building an inflexible demo, but to do more research to find a scaleable solution.</p>
  <p class="text">In this case, we found that instead of using a two solutions tied together with hard code, that an end-to-end technology is a better solution that reduces complexity and offers additional benefits in the form of analytics and integrations.</p>
  <p class="text">It's great to have the chance to work directly with clients in my pursuit to become a better Product Manager. I've learned that it is extremely important to fully comprehend a client's vision and goals before moving into the design/build process. It saved me weeks of time and prevented them from wasting money on a semi-useful product that wouldn't scale.</p>

  <p class="text">With all of our team members having full time commitments (jobs, school, clients), our building process with Stash has been divided and inconsistent. This has led to a gap between design and development where neither side is aware of what the other is working on. We have a sprint board for development, but the design work hasn't been tracked.</p>
  <p class="text">Our team needs a better way to keep track of all of our work in one place so we can set goals together, log our work, and hold each other accountable. The solution is to include design objectives to our sprint board and shorten the sprints to one week.</p>

  <p class="text">My web work day got shortened because I went to work as a photographer tonight in DC.</p>
  <p class="text">One of the things I was learning about before I left was how to create a museum view for Stash's cards. The main problem with the current version is that items are added in columns instead of in rows. The only way to get the items to position themselves in rows is to use a technique called Masonry.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/LUewtho.gif"/>
  <p class="text">There are plugins that enable this dynamic positioning in React that I will need to use to create this effect. That'll have to wait a couple days though because I'm headed to NYC with Kristina tomorrow morning 🗽!</p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1f1135p.gif"/>
  <p class="text">The design is nice, but items that only have a favicon or no image at all create gaps in the layout. Another concern is that it only adds content to the left column rather than adding items across horizontally in rows. That may cause confusion for the user in regards to which items were most recently saved.</p>
  <p class="text">I don't think we're quite ready to implement something like the museum view until we can grab screenshots of webpages that don't have meta images. More on this in the future.</p>

    <p class="text">Being a product manager is my true role. I love driving products from concept to reality by connecting business, development, and design.</p>
    <p class="text">But defining my role as a product manager can be difficult at times because every circumstance need something different. I am constantly having to adapt to the needs of my product, market, and teammates while balancing both budget and time.</p>
    <p class="text">So I spent some time today researching more about how other people define the role of a product manager and the techniques they use to optimize their effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="text">I found a lot of stuff, but one thing that I really like is this graphic.</p>

    <p class="text">It does a very good job of breaking down the areas a PM is involved with and the responsibilities within each area of focus.</p>

    <p class="text">The conversation was extremely helpful in identifying where her painpoints lie and how we can shape Stash's experience to solve her problems.</p>
    <p class="text">Talking with Mishi also gave us a better understanding of who our target audience is. I'm not going to draw any conclusions yet, but we're excited to conduct more interviews to see if there are any consistent patterns.</p>

    <p class="text">One topic that has captured my attention recently is global warming. There is so much controversy surrounding the issue, but there is no denying that human carbon emissions are causing alarming outcomes.</p>
    <p class="text">Even though climate change has been gaining media coverage, people still seem to be unaware of the long term consequences from our current carbon output or don't care enough to make changes in their daily lives.</p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9qtGfmN.jpg"/>
    <p class="text">I want to do my part to help inform others about the realities of global warming by creating a interactive inforgraphic about climate change.</p>
    <p class="text">I've started collecting research and here are some of the mind-boggling facts that I found:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every single day, 70 million tons of carbon dioxide are released into the earth’s atmosphere. That’s 1.4 billion pounds – yesterday, today, tomorrow... <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/al-gore-nyu-law-9-18-06-60acdb2cb08f#.5szwf7emr">[1]</a></li>
      <li>Since temperature record-keeping began in 1880, the 10 warmest years on record have been in the past 12 years. <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2008/">[2]</a></li>
      <li>20 million tons of ice are lost per day from just one glacier in Greenland. This amount of daily ice lost is equal to the amount of water that New York City uses in an entire year. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-gore/a-generational-challenge_b_113359.html">[3]</a></li>
      <li>Over a hundred million people will be displaced by just a 1-yard rise in sea levels. Many scientists predict that the oceans will rise at least this much by 2100. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html">[4]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">I don't want my children and grandchildren to never experience snow, or to have to wear medicical masks just to prevent them from inhaling smog. We only have one Earth, lets make changes to keep it habitable for future generations.</p>

    <p class="text">While working with Osebo on Stash today, we decided to dig into the true problem that we're attempting to solve with Stash. It started with a question. <b>Why do people collect things?</b></p>
    <p class="text quote">"Collecting is a basic human instinct; a survival advantage amplified by eons of natural selection. Those of our ancient ancestors who managed to accumulate scarce objects may have been more prone to survive long enough to bear offspring." <a class="source" href="https://www.ha.com/intelligent-collector/why-do-we-collect-things.s?article=collect">(source)</a></p>
    <img src="http://imgur.com/2Xid92T.jpg">
    <p class="text">If you think about it, everyone collects something. Baseball cards, money, pictures, letters from loved ones, sneakers... something. Our motivations to collect stem from a few common reasons including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge and learning</li>
      <li>Relaxation and stress reduction</li>
      <li>Personal pleasure</li>
      <li>Social interaction with fellow collectors and others</li>
      <li>Competitive challenge</li>
      <li>Recognition by fellow collectors and perhaps even non-collectors</li>
      <li>The desire to control, possess and bring order to part of the world</li>
      <li>Nostalgia and/or a connection to history</li>
      <li>Accumulation and diversification of wealth </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="text">So how does this apply to Stash? We feel like collecting content on the web is <b>difficult</b>, <b>unappealing</b>, and <b>hidden</b> from others who can find value in it.</p>
    <p class="text">Right now, to collect webpages, images, videos, etc., people either: share links on chat platforms where they get lost in conversation, create bookmark folders that often get forgotten/cluttered, or build websites for their collection, which take a significant amount of time and effort to create/maintain.</p>
    <p class="text">Our goal is to make it easier for people to create, share, and discover collections of their favorite media.</p>
