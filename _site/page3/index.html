  <p class="text">Getting both design and development back together on the sprint board was very effective in helping the team stay on track and we were able to set clear objectives for the next week.</p>
  <p class="text">We have a collage view in the pipeline that will replace the grid view and we're finishing up profiles so users can truly create their own stashes. In the meantime, checkout the latest version <a href="http://staging.stash.ag">here</a>.</p>

  <p class="text">Superbowl Sunday is basically a holiday in the US, but I did have a photography gig this morning in Baltimore. Luckily it ended at 4pm, so I was still able to participate in the Superbowl festivities.</p>
  <p class="text">The game was between the Atlanta Falcons & the New England Patriots. The first three quarters of the game were all Atlanta with the Falcons holding a 28 to 3 lead at one point.</p>
  <p class="text">But some how, Tom Brady led his team back in the 4th quarter to tie the game at 28, force overtime, and drive down the field in overtime to score a game winning touchdown to win his 5th Superbowl. Epic.</p>

  <p class="text">This past month I mentioned that I had acquired a new client that is looking to build a livestreaming video platform for webroadcasts and webinars.</p>
  <p class="text">We've spent the past few weeks outlining a scope of work and digging into the details to develop a full understanding of the company vision as well as what's required to get to an MVP.</p>
  <p class="text">After multiple sessions of ironing out the specifics, it became apparent that the best path to success wasn't to just start building an inflexible demo, but to do more research to find a scaleable solution.</p>
  <p class="text">In this case, we found that instead of using a two solutions tied together with hard code, that an end-to-end technology is a better solution that reduces complexity and offers additional benefits in the form of analytics and integrations.</p>
  <p class="text">It's great to have the chance to work directly with clients in my pursuit to become a better Product Manager. I've learned that it is extremely important to fully comprehend a client's vision and goals before moving into the design/build process. It saved me weeks of time and prevented them from wasting money on a semi-useful product that wouldn't scale.</p>

  <p class="text">The needs of each team change over time and as a product manager it's my job to make decisions to improve the effectiveness of the team's workflow.</p>
  <p class="text">With all of our team members having full time commitments (jobs, school, clients), our building process with Stash has been divided and inconsistent. This has led to a gap between design and development where neither side is aware of what the other is working on. We have a sprint board for development, but the design work hasn't been tracked.</p>
  <p class="text">Our team needs a better way to keep track of all of our work in one place so we can set goals together, log our work, and hold each other accountable. The solution is to include design objectives to our sprint board and shorten the sprints to one week.</p>
