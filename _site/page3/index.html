  <p class="text">She said that she's been using sticky notes to collect links and write notes, but that is has gotten extremely unorganized and overwhelming.</p>
  <p class="text">The conclusion of the conversation was that she needed a solution that she equated to "Pinterest for the workplace." Once she said it, it was immeadiately evident that that was the niche we need to pursue.</p>
