    <p class="text">Today, Diego and I spent some quality time together working on Stash. We're working on creating left and right arrows for moving between items within the overlay.</p>
    <p class="text">It required quite of bit of refactoring and requires manipulating the global state with Redux.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm happy that Diego has been taking the time to walk me through the relationships between the actions, dispatches, reducers and states.</p>
    <p class="text">Learning this component based framework is hard work, but I know it will pay off. Excited to share the experience with you soon.</p>

    <p class="text">Being a product manager is my true role. I love driving products from concept to reality by connecting business, development, and design.</p>
    <p class="text">But defining my role as a product manager can be difficult at times because every circumstance need something different. I am constantly having to adapt to the needs of my product, market, and teammates while balancing both budget and time.</p>
    <p class="text">So I spent some time today researching more about how other people define the role of a product manager and the techniques they use to optimize their effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="text">I found a lot of stuff, but one thing that I really like is this graphic.</p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bbMdbCR.jpg">
    <p class="text">It does a very good job of breaking down the areas a PM is involved with and the responsibilities within each area of focus.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm going to continue to soak up more knowledge and use the insights to start applying for roles as a PM.</p>

    <p class="text">Gulp is a javascript task runner that helps automate tasks like bundling code and minifying images/gifs etc.</p>
    <p class="text">Because my personal site will have a lot of heavy imagery, I decided to use gulp to build my personal site so that it's fast and snappy.</p>
    <p class="text">I like it's plugin/modular infrastructure and the fact that it uses sass by default.</p>
    <p class="text">On another note, the site design continues to change as I show people and get feedback. I'm think I'm goint to adjust my user flow so that there are individual pages for each project.</p>

    <p class="text">Highlighting my frontend work is a priority, so I've made it easy to access my work from a fixed sidebar on the right.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm also going to make the images interactive. When a visitor hovers over one of the designs, it will trigger an accompanying video that will show engagements like hover to play or chopping a video.</p>
    <p class="text">It is definitely a thought provoking process breaking down what's important and I'm excited to see it take shape.</p>
