  <p class="text">I have a lot of experience working with YouTube's player, but I haven't spent much time working with Vimeo's player yet. I thought it would be a cool challenge to see if I could recreate hover to play viewing with Vimeo's player.</p>

  <p class="text">This past month I mentioned that I had acquired a new client that is looking to build a livestreaming video platform for webroadcasts and webinars.</p>
  <p class="text">We've spent the past few weeks outlining a scope of work and digging into the details to develop a full understanding of the company vision as well as what's required to get to an MVP.</p>
  <p class="text">After multiple sessions of ironing out the specifics, it became apparent that the best path to success wasn't to just start building an inflexible demo, but to do more research to find a scaleable solution.</p>
  <p class="text">In this case, we found that instead of using a two solutions tied together with hard code, that an end-to-end technology is a better solution that reduces complexity and offers additional benefits in the form of analytics and integrations.</p>
  <p class="text">It's great to have the chance to work directly with clients in my pursuit to become a better Product Manager. I've learned that it is extremely important to fully comprehend a client's vision and goals before moving into the design/build process. It saved me weeks of time and prevented them from wasting money on a semi-useful product that wouldn't scale.</p>

  <p class="text">The needs of each team change over time and as a product manager it's my job to make decisions to improve the effectiveness of the team's workflow.</p>
  <p class="text">With all of our team members having full time commitments (jobs, school, clients), our building process with Stash has been divided and inconsistent. This has led to a gap between design and development where neither side is aware of what the other is working on. We have a sprint board for development, but the design work hasn't been tracked.</p>
  <p class="text">Our team needs a better way to keep track of all of our work in one place so we can set goals together, log our work, and hold each other accountable. The solution is to include design objectives to our sprint board and shorten the sprints to one week.</p>

  <p class="text">My web work day got shortened because I went to work as a photographer tonight in DC.</p>
  <p class="text">One of the things I was learning about before I left was how to create a museum view for Stash's cards. The main problem with the current version is that items are added in columns instead of in rows. The only way to get the items to position themselves in rows is to use a technique called Masonry.</p>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/LUewtho.gif"/>
  <p class="text">There are plugins that enable this dynamic positioning in React that I will need to use to create this effect. That'll have to wait a couple days though because I'm headed to NYC with Kristina tomorrow morning 🗽!</p>
