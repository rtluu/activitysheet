        <title>Lazy loading and a potential new brand</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I started working on a lazy loading feature for Stash that would optimize loading efficiency for the experience and more importantly reduce the amount of calls we make to iframely. The more calls we make the more money we pay, so this is an important improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Osebo and I have also been trying to figure out a new brand identify for Stash because of the confusion that's created by other companies that have the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today we came up with forshow.co. I actually really like it. Creating collections for showing other people is the goal, so the name makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/aXfDjRG.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Side note, I had my phone interview today and I have been invited to a second round interview ðŸ˜€!

        <title>Deployed a new Stash</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The Stash team finished our one week sprint today with a successful deployment to our testing server. User signup/login in now working along with a new design of the items and item overlays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/XCUrepk.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Getting both design and development back together on the sprint board was very effective in helping the team stay on track and we were able to set clear objectives for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;We have a collage view in the pipeline that will replace the grid view and we're finishing up profiles so users can truly create their own stashes. In the meantime, checkout the latest version &lt;a href=&quot;http://staging.stash.ag&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Legendary Comeback</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Superbowl Sunday is basically a holiday in the US, but I did have a photography gig this morning in Baltimore. Luckily it ended at 4pm, so I was still able to participate in the Superbowl festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The game was between the Atlanta Falcons &amp; the New England Patriots. The first three quarters of the game were all Atlanta with the Falcons holding a 28 to 3 lead at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;But some how, Tom Brady led his team back in the 4th quarter to tie the game at 28, force overtime, and drive down the field in overtime to score a game winning touchdown to win his 5th Superbowl. Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ufH5AhR.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It goes to show that the greatest winners in life, never give up no matter how grim the situation looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Completed the Vimeo Demo</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I finished the Vimeo hover to play demo this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/0oXFMZ2.gif?1&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm really  happy with how it came out! You can try the experience for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;http://rtluu.github.io/vimeodemo&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (web only*).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Vimeo Experiment</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, I have a interview with Vimeo for a Creative Technologist position with a focus on their video player. I'm excited!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I have a lot of experience working with YouTube's player, but I haven't spent much time working with Vimeo's player yet. I thought it would be a cool challenge to see if I could recreate hover to play viewing with Vimeo's player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/nyFkUjZ.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm not quite sure how difficult it's going to be, but it should be fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>More info in item overlay</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Osebo and I spent time today trying to figure out how we can show additional information about each item after it's opened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;He can up with a few designs and the one that we decided to build looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Jwb1I2v.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It seems pretty straight forward, but it is extremely hard to get the block on the right to scale appropriately when the content on the left varies in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm hoping to find a way to make it work, but we may need to redesign the more info block.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Consulting before building the wrong thing</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This past month I mentioned that I had acquired a new client that is looking to build a livestreaming video platform for webroadcasts and webinars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;We've spent the past few weeks outlining a scope of work and digging into the details to develop a full understanding of the company vision as well as what's required to get to an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;After multiple sessions of ironing out the specifics, it became apparent that the best path to success wasn't to just start building an inflexible demo, but to do more research to find a scaleable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In this case, we found that instead of using a two solutions tied together with hard code, that an end-to-end technology is a better solution that reduces complexity and offers additional benefits in the form of analytics and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It's great to have the chance to work directly with clients in my pursuit to become a better Product Manager. I've learned that it is extremely important to fully comprehend a client's vision and goals before moving into the design/build process. It saved me weeks of time and prevented them from wasting money on a semi-useful product that wouldn't scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Checking off tickets at WeWork</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I took a trip downtown to tour two different WeWork offices today. The first one was near the White House and the other was in Dupont Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/02OHHnq.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It was nice to work in a new environment and I was able to check off all but one of my tickets on the sprint board. Another plus was being able to get feedback from random people in the coworking space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm not sure if it makes sense for me to commit to the coworking space at this point, but I'm going to sleep on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>One week sprints for a better workflow</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The needs of each team change over time and as a product manager it's my job to make decisions to improve the effectiveness of the team's workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;With all of our team members having full time commitments (jobs, school, clients), our building process with Stash has been divided and inconsistent. This has led to a gap between design and development where neither side is aware of what the other is working on. We have a sprint board for development, but the design work hasn't been tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Our team needs a better way to keep track of all of our work in one place so we can set goals together, log our work, and hold each other accountable. The solution is to include design objectives to our sprint board and shorten the sprints to one week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/oF0yjbH.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm excited to see how this improves our workflow. Grind time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The High Line and The Whitney Museum</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Continuing our adventure in New York, we walked the High Line this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;And visited the Whitney in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/CW4WGg1.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The trip to NYC was a blast; can't wait to do more exploring soon!&lt;/p&gt;
