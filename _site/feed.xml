        <title>New design for my personal site</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I spent time today continuing to refine the purpose and vision for my personal site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/post-images/site_mockup_v2.png&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Highlighting my frontend work is a priority, so I've made it easy to access my work from a fixed sidebar on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm also going to make the images interactive. When a visitor hovers over one of the design it will showcase a unique engagement like hover to play or chopping a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It is definitely a thought provoking process breaking down what's important and I'm excited to see it take shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Conducting problem interviews for Stash</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Products need to solve problems. Whether it's telling you the time or autonomously driving you to work, products are created to solve a human problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today, Osebo and I interviewed a bio-med engineering masters student named Mishi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/aRv0Pzb.gif&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;She was super nice and gave us a lot of great insight into her daily experience of discovering and saving online. Her go-to service is/was Tumblr, but it's gotten really cluttered and difficult for her to easily revisit her favorite content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The conversation was extremely helpful in identifying where her painpoints lie and how we can shape Stash's experience to solve her problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Talking with Mishi also gave us a better understanding of who our target audience is. I'm not going to draw any conclusions yet, but we're excited to conduct more interviews to see if there are any consistent patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Collecting facts on climate change for an interactive infographic</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/zCgAoLk.jpg&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;One topic that has captured my attention recently is global warming. There is so much controversy surrounding the issue, but there is no denying that human carbon emissions are causing alarming outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Even though climate change has been gaining media coverage, people still seem to be unaware of the long term consequences from our current carbon output or don't care enough to make changes in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/9qtGfmN.jpg&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I want to do my part to help inform others about the realities of global warming by creating a interactive inforgraphic about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I've started collecting research and here are some of the mind-boggling facts that I found:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Every single day, 70 million tons of carbon dioxide are released into the earth’s atmosphere. That’s 1.4 billion pounds – yesterday, today, tomorrow... &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/al-gore-nyu-law-9-18-06-60acdb2cb08f#.5szwf7emr&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Since temperature record-keeping began in 1880, the 10 warmest years on record have been in the past 12 years. &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2008/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;20 million tons of ice are lost per day from just one glacier in Greenland. This amount of daily ice lost is equal to the amount of water that New York City uses in an entire year. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-gore/a-generational-challenge_b_113359.html&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Over a hundred million people will be displaced by just a 1-yard rise in sea levels. Many scientists predict that the oceans will rise at least this much by 2100. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I don't want my children and grandchildren to never experience snow, or to have to wear medicical masks just to prevent them from inhaling smog. We only have one Earth, lets make changes to keep it habitable for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back to the drawing board for my personal site</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Dpfprkv.jpg&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I realized that I got ahead of myself with my first crack at my personal site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Osebo suggested that I take more time to think through the purpose of my personal site and to sketch multiple iterations before touching the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;My goals with my personal site are to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Showcase my web work through individual case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Convey my multi-disciplinary background and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Capture viewers attention and entice them to contact me.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keep things minimal while adding my own personal flare.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use a new Javascript library to create a unique interactive.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I also think I'm going to build my personal site in gulp.js. I've never used it before, but I know it's fast and I've heard good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Making music discovery less cloudy with Rainbow</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Osebo, Sid, and I started building an easy way to see what your friends are liking on Soundcloud called Rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Over the past 2 weeks we've interviewed a variety of people to understand how they use Soundcloud and if they are interesting in seeing what their friends are listening to. Most if not all said yes, so we are building it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/yN8IPg4.gif&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;landing_interation_01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This is the first iteration of the landing page that I whipped up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Revamping my personal site</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;My personal site is in need of a face lift, so I spent some time today mocking up a few design interations in Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/zjQYLCt.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;personal site mockup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I want to make it minimal while still conveying my diverse breadth of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This design seems a little overwhelming. I need to take more time to think out the userflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Sidenote, I'm back in the hospital with my girlfriend again. I might have to make this place my second office ⍨.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Overnight stay in the hospital and building in Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/cXuMjn6.gif&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I didn't get any sleep last night. I was with my gf in the hospital overnight and it was pretty brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Luckily, I brought my hotspot/laptop and while we were waiting I decided to rebuild my activity sheet in Jekyll per suggestion of Osebo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Creating posts are sooo much easier and it improves the load efficiency significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;We were having trouble getting the images in the yaml frontmatter to render on the homepage, but I was able to figure it out. It makes the homepage way more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'm going to continue to push myself to experiment with new programming languages this year. Some of the ones I'm currently interested in are Angular, Gulp and React. I'll keep buildings new things and will post them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Researching the psychology of collecting</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/5RiIotI.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;While working with Osebo on Stash today, we decided to dig into the true problem that we're attempting to solve with Stash. It started with a question. &lt;b&gt;Why do people collect things?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Collecting is a basic human instinct; a survival advantage amplified by eons of natural selection. Those of our ancient ancestors who managed to accumulate scarce objects may have been more prone to survive long enough to bear offspring.&quot; &lt;a class=&quot;source&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ha.com/intelligent-collector/why-do-we-collect-things.s?article=collect&quot;&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/2Xid92T.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;If you think about it, everyone collects something. Baseball cards, money, pictures, letters from loved ones, sneakers... something. Our motivations to collect stem from a few common reasons including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Knowledge and learning&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Relaxation and stress reduction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Personal pleasure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social interaction with fellow collectors and others&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Competitive challenge&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recognition by fellow collectors and perhaps even non-collectors&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The desire to control, possess and bring order to part of the world&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Nostalgia and/or a connection to history&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Accumulation and diversification of wealth &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;So how does this apply to Stash? We feel like collecting content on the web is &lt;b&gt;difficult&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;unappealing&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;hidden&lt;/b&gt; from others who can find value in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Right now, to collect webpages, images, videos, etc., people either: share links on chat platforms where they get lost in conversation, create bookmark folders that often get forgotten/cluttered, or build websites for their collection, which take a significant amount of time and effort to create/maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Our goal is to make it easier for people to create, share, and discover collections of their favorite media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>I'm making a daily activity sheet.</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/8FtI3o8.gif&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;To start 2017, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brendanluu.github.io&quot;&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osebo.github.io/activitysheet&quot;&gt;Osebo&lt;/a&gt; and I decided to make activity sheets to push ourselves to create new stuff everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I'll use this space to document the things I'm working on, share my ideas and record my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today I upgraded to a new '15 macbook 🙌🏼 . It's nice to start a new year with fresh hardware that will allow me to continue to improve my programming and design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;One of the things I'm looking forward to most in 2017 is building &lt;a href=&quot;http://stash.ag&quot;&gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt;. Osebo, Diego and I have been working hard and will be relasing an MVP soon. Off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
