        <title>More Mobile</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today was all about finishing more mobile media queries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/7CJsgBt.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The navigation now changes when the users scrolls past a certain height and the item overlays on mobile are swift with left/right arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Mobile Media Queries V1</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Responsive design is extremely important especially when mobile is often the first impression a user has with a new product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I started working on the media queries to make Stash's design mobile friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ghzS1RI.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It is coming along nicely, but there is still a lot of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Collections for your workflow</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I had a great conversation today with an old friend about her problems collecting content at work. She's works in government and spends a lot of time researching politicians collecting articles, videos and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;She said that she's been using sticky notes to collect links and write notes, but that is has gotten extremely unorganized and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The conclusion of the conversation was that she needed a solution that she equated to &quot;Pinterest for the workplace.&quot; Once she said it, it was immeadiately evident that that was the niche we need to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I suggested for her to try the beta and will be following up with her and her team to learn more about how we can improve their collection and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today I was able to get the key press events to work inside of the item overlays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/HFaaBC0.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;They're really nice and the experience is really snappy thanks to React.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;We're finshing up a few last fixes and we should be launching to production within the week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Merged collage view</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It's been a little while but we were finally able to merge the collage view into Stash.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/lG7ARCx.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Side note: we've decided to keep the name Stash for now because at this point users aren't creating collections for show, they are saving things for themselves. We are keeping the new eye mark though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Rainbow V1</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Sid, Osebo and I were able to get a MVP version of Rainbow working!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/t8A0rth.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It's been quite a challenge due to a couple unforseen constraints. The primary one is the inability to build and make changes locally. In order for the experience to work, the user must authenticate with soundcloud's api.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Despite the roadblocks, we've been able to get a list of people you follow and when you select someone, it shows their soundcloud likes via embeds. Soundcloud's embeds are pretty load heavy so we've implemented lazy loading to reduce load times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Next we're looking at creating our own soundcloud player so we don't need to rely on the embeds and can create a more fluid experience where songs play in successsion.
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Exhausting photography double</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I really enjoy sharing updates on the things I'm building, but somedays it isn't so glamorous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today, I worked a double for my photography job and was out of the house from 9am to 1am. It was long, and tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;BUT, I can't complain because this job gives me the flexibility to focus my energy on creating during the work week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Forshow landing layer</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Forshow's landing page needed an update now that we're changing the brand, so I worked with Osebo to create a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Il3XLfq.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;There are some concerns about hiding the examples at first and we will likely reorganize the message to show the examples upfront. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Rainbow's first working UX</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Rainbow is a side project to help people discover music their friends are listening to. Osebo, Sid and I worked to put together the first working UX.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/j1S4q3k.gif&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Users sign in with their SoundCloud account and Rainbow shows a list of the people they are following. When a user clicks on one of their friends, their friend's liked songs from SoundCloud will display in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;A working demo will be ready by this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>New Nav &amp; Add Link</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Today I spent time rebuilding the navigation for Forshow; including a new design of the add item form.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/k5rlSUQ.gif?1&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Below the nav bar, we have added a user profile block. For an anonymous user it will have a smiley face and once they log in it will show their username and have the ability to add a photo (which we still need to build).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;It's coming together, but there are still a lot of things to get done in this sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
