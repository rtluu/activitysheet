    <p class="text">One topic that has captured my attention recently is global warming. There is so much controversy surrounding the issue, but there is no denying that human carbon emissions are causing alarming outcomes.</p>
    <p class="text">Even though climate change has been gaining media coverage, people still seem to be unaware of the long term consequences from our current carbon output or don't care enough to make changes in their daily lives.</p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9qtGfmN.jpg"/>
    <p class="text">I want to do my part to help inform others about the realities of global warming by creating a interactive inforgraphic about climate change.</p>
    <p class="text">I've started collecting research and here are some of the mind-boggling facts that I found:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every single day, 70 million tons of carbon dioxide are released into the earth’s atmosphere. That’s 1.4 billion pounds – yesterday, today, tomorrow... <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/al-gore-nyu-law-9-18-06-60acdb2cb08f#.5szwf7emr">[1]</a></li>
      <li>Since temperature record-keeping began in 1880, the 10 warmest years on record have been in the past 12 years. <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2008/">[2]</a></li>
      <li>20 million tons of ice are lost per day from just one glacier in Greenland. This amount of daily ice lost is equal to the amount of water that New York City uses in an entire year. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-gore/a-generational-challenge_b_113359.html">[3]</a></li>
      <li>Over a hundred million people will be displaced by just a 1-yard rise in sea levels. Many scientists predict that the oceans will rise at least this much by 2100. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html">[4]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">I don't want my children and grandchildren to never experience snow, or to have to wear medicical masks just to prevent them from inhaling smog. We only have one Earth, lets make changes to keep it habitable for future generations.</p>

    <p class="text">Osebo suggested that I take more time to think through the purpose of my personal site and to sketch multiple iterations before touching the computer.</p>
    <p class="text">My goals with my personal site are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Showcase my web work through individual case studies.</li>
      <li>Convey my multi-disciplinary background and experience.</li>
      <li>Capture viewers attention and entice them to contact me.</li>
      <li>Keep things minimal while adding my own personal flare.</li>
      <li>Use a new Javascript library to create a unique interactive.</li>

    <p class="text">Luckily, I brought my hotspot/laptop and while we were waiting I decided to rebuild my activity sheet in Jekyll per suggestion of Osebo.</p>
    <p class="text">Creating posts are sooo much easier and it improves the load efficiency significantly.</p>
    <p class="text">We were having trouble getting the images in the yaml frontmatter to render on the homepage, but I was able to figure it out. It makes the homepage way more appealing.</p>
    <p class="text">I'm going to continue to push myself to experiment with new programming languages this year. Some of the ones I'm currently interested in are Angular, Gulp and React. I'll keep buildings new things and will post them here.</p>

    <p class="text">While working with Osebo on Stash today, we decided to dig into the true problem that we're attempting to solve with Stash. It started with a question. <b>Why do people collect things?</b></p>
    <p class="text quote">"Collecting is a basic human instinct; a survival advantage amplified by eons of natural selection. Those of our ancient ancestors who managed to accumulate scarce objects may have been more prone to survive long enough to bear offspring." <a class="source" href="https://www.ha.com/intelligent-collector/why-do-we-collect-things.s?article=collect">(source)</a></p>
    <img src="http://imgur.com/2Xid92T.jpg">
    <p class="text">If you think about it, everyone collects something. Baseball cards, money, pictures, letters from loved ones, sneakers... something. Our motivations to collect stem from a few common reasons including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge and learning</li>
      <li>Relaxation and stress reduction</li>
      <li>Personal pleasure</li>
      <li>Social interaction with fellow collectors and others</li>
      <li>Competitive challenge</li>
      <li>Recognition by fellow collectors and perhaps even non-collectors</li>
      <li>The desire to control, possess and bring order to part of the world</li>
      <li>Nostalgia and/or a connection to history</li>
      <li>Accumulation and diversification of wealth </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="text">So how does this apply to Stash? We feel like collecting content on the web is <b>difficult</b>, <b>unappealing</b>, and <b>hidden</b> from others who can find value in it.</p>
    <p class="text">Right now, to collect webpages, images, videos, etc., people either: share links on chat platforms where they get lost in conversation, create bookmark folders that often get forgotten/cluttered, or build websites for their collection, which take a significant amount of time and effort to create/maintain.</p>
    <p class="text">Our goal is to make it easier for people to create, share, and discover collections of their favorite media.</p>
