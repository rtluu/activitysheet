  <p class="text">I had a great conversation today with an old friend about her problems collecting content at work. She's works in government and spends a lot of time researching politicians collecting articles, videos and more.</p>
  <p class="text">She said that she's been using sticky notes to collect links and write notes, but that is has gotten extremely unorganized and overwhelming.</p>
  <p class="text">The conclusion of the conversation was that she needed a solution that she equated to "Pinterest for the workplace." Once she said it, it was immeadiately evident that that was the niche we need to pursue.</p>
  <p class="text">I suggested for her to try the beta and will be following up with her and her team to learn more about how we can improve their collection and collaboration.</p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/t8A0rth.gif"/>
  <p class="text">It's been quite a challenge due to a couple unforseen constraints. The primary one is the inability to build and make changes locally. In order for the experience to work, the user must authenticate with soundcloud's api.</p>
  <p class="text">Despite the roadblocks, we've been able to get a list of people you follow and when you select someone, it shows their soundcloud likes via embeds. Soundcloud's embeds are pretty load heavy so we've implemented lazy loading to reduce load times.</p>
  <p class="text">Next we're looking at creating our own soundcloud player so we don't need to rely on the embeds and can create a more fluid experience where songs play in successsion.

  <p class="text">I started working on a lazy loading feature for Stash that would optimize loading efficiency for the experience and more importantly reduce the amount of calls we make to iframely. The more calls we make the more money we pay, so this is an important improvement.</p>
  <p class="text">Osebo and I have also been trying to figure out a new brand identify for Stash because of the confusion that's created by other companies that have the same name.</p>
  <p class="text">Today we came up with forshow.co. I actually really like it. Creating collections for showing other people is the goal, so the name makes a lot of sense.</p>

  <p class="text">We have a collage view in the pipeline that will replace the grid view and we're finishing up profiles so users can truly create their own stashes. In the meantime, checkout the latest version <a href="http://staging.stash.ag">here</a>.</p>
