    <p class="text">One topic that has captured my attention recently is global warming. There is so much controversy surrounding the issue, but there is no denying that human carbon emissions are causing alarming outcomes.</p>
    <p class="text">Even though climate change has been gaining media coverage, people still seem to be unaware of the long term consequences from our current carbon output or don't care enough to make changes in their daily lives.</p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9qtGfmN.jpg"/>
    <p class="text">I want to do my part to help inform others about the realities of global warming by creating a interactive inforgraphic about climate change.</p>
    <p class="text">I've started collecting research and here are some of the mind-boggling facts that I found:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every single day, 70 million tons of carbon dioxide are released into the earthâ€™s atmosphere. Thatâ€™s 1.4 billion pounds â€“ yesterday, today, tomorrow... <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/al-gore-nyu-law-9-18-06-60acdb2cb08f#.5szwf7emr">[1]</a></li>
      <li>Since temperature record-keeping began in 1880, the 10 warmest years on record have been in the past 12 years. <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2008/">[2]</a></li>
      <li>20 million tons of ice are lost per day from just one glacier in Greenland. This amount of daily ice lost is equal to the amount of water that New York City uses in an entire year. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-gore/a-generational-challenge_b_113359.html">[3]</a></li>
      <li>Over a hundred million people will be displaced by just a 1-yard rise in sea levels. Many scientists predict that the oceans will rise at least this much by 2100. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html">[4]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">I don't want my children and grandchildren to never experience snow, or to have to wear medicical masks just to prevent them from inhaling smog. We only have one Earth, lets make changes to keep it habitable for future generations.</p>
