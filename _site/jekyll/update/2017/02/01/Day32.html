  <p class="text">This past month I mentioned that I had acquired a new client that is looking to build a livestreaming video platform for webroadcasts and webinars.</p>
  <p class="text">We've spent the past few weeks outlining a scope of work and digging into the details to develop a full understanding of the company vision as well as what's required to get to an MVP.</p>
  <p class="text">After multiple sessions of ironing out the specifics, it became apparent that the best path to success wasn't to just start building an inflexible demo, but to do more research to find a scaleable solution.</p>
  <p class="text">In this case, we found that instead of using a two solutions tied together with hard code, that an end-to-end technology is a better solution that reduces complexity and offers additional benefits in the form of analytics and integrations.</p>
  <p class="text">It's great to have the chance to work directly with clients in my pursuit to become a better Product Manager. I've learned that it is extremely important to fully comprehend a client's vision and goals before moving into the design/build process. It saved me weeks of time and prevented them from wasting money on a semi-useful product that wouldn't scale.</p>
